<h1>About Me:</h1>
<p>I am a Front End Developer who has a passion for building and making my clients dreams come true. I have been coding for awhile and I love the challenge of being given an idea and making the best out of it that I can. Also being able to run free with a project to let my creative side flow into the things that I make for myself and others.</p>
